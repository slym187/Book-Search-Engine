# Description
The Book Search Engine is a full-stack MERN application that enables users to search for books and manage their favorite book collections. By leveraging the power of the Google Books API, users can easily search for books by title, author, or keywords, and save their favorite books to their personal collection.

This application features a user-friendly interface built with React, integrated with Apollo Client for handling GraphQL queries and mutations. Users can create an account, log in securely, and view or remove books from their saved list. The back-end is powered by Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Apollo Server, providing robust and secure handling of user authentication, data storage, and API interactions.
